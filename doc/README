WebKNotes - Web Knowledge Notes.

WeKNotes is an experimental system of cataloging information about ANYTHING and
everything. 

The storage of the notes is actually just a diretory tree.
The guts of the system is a set of CGI Perl scripts.

I have recently added the following features:
	* ability to tag the TYPE of NOTE(subject, answer, question)
	* enhanded SEARCH util to search for specific types of notes.
XX	* NEW: Ability to SUBSCRIBE to any topic( and recieve all new
		notes by email)
XX	* Ability to Add topics via EMAIL<br>
ZZ	* Allow browsing using frames.

XX - removed for now
ZZ - disabled. Who likes frames?

Some possible future additions:
	Ability to reply to a knotes email and have it put in DB
	Abreviations for note paths.(KN:fvwm = KN:/X/window_managers/fvwm)
	Ability to subscribe to a flat dir in addition to a dir tree.
	Ability to usubscribe ALL.
	Use of Auth. files to allow restricted note modifications.
	Ability to download the entire archive(as a tar.gz file) or part of it.
