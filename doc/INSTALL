The installation creates an installation tree as follows:

What you need to get started:

Perl5 - installed as /usr/bin/perl
(if somewhere else, you need to modify all .cgi scripts using (util/perlpath) )

CGI.pm - part of standard Perl 5 dist.

To allow one user to own and modify all the notes(via the cgi scripts),
you need one of these on your web server:
    -setuid perl enabled(suidperl)
       chmod u+s *.cgi
    -cgi-wrap - http://www.unixtools.org/cgiwrap/
    -setuid apache module(suEXEC) enabled.
       http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html
     -use setuid_wrapper that was available with perl4
     -compile and use util/sperl_user.c
       cd util
       cc sperl_user -o sperl_`whoami`
       chmod a+x,u+s sperl_`whoami`
       using util/perlpath, change all cgi scripts to point to this exe.


webknotes/
	example/		- sample directory structure for WebKNotes
	cgi-bin/wkn	- wkn cgi scripts
        cgi-bin/auth    - auth cgi scripts

To get the basic WebKNotes system working you need to:
(For the impatient, the next section has step by step commands)
   - unpackage(gunzip < webknotes.tgz | tar xvf -) wkn.
   - link or move wkn and auth cgi-bin dirs to somewhere visible on web.
   - Create a directory structure with public and private directories.
     (similar to those in the example directory).
   - The public directory should also be linked or moved to a location
     visible on the web.
   - cd cgi-bin/wkn && cp wkn_define_sample.pl wkn_define.pl
   - modify cgi-bin/wkn/wkn_define.pl for your system.
   - cd cgi-bin/auth && cp auth_define_sample.pl auth_define.pl
   - modify cgi-bin/auth/auth_define.pl for your system.
   - do whatever is required to have the cgi-scripts run as the owner of
          the 'notes' directory.
        setuid perl scripts. ( chmod u+s cgi-bin/wkn/*cgi cgi-bin/auth/*cgi
        using cgi-wrap.
        using setuid apache module.

Here are the step by step commands that I ran to get wkn running from
scratch on MY system:
   cd ~
   tar zxvf webknotes.tgz 
   cd webknotes
   mv example/* .
   cd ..
   mkdir -p public_html/cgi-bin 
   ln -s ~/webknotes/cgi-bin/* public_html/cgi-bin
   ln -s ~/webknotes/public/* public_html
   cd webknotes/cgi-bin/wkn
   cp wkn_define_sample.pl wkn_define.pl
   vi wkn_define.pl
   cd ../auth
   cp auth_define_sample.pl auth_define.pl
   vi auth_define.pl
   cd ../../..
