The installation creates an installation tree as follows:

What you need to get started:

Perl5 - installed as /usr/bin/perl
(if somewhere else, you need to modify all .cgi scripts using (util/perlpath) )

CGI.pm - part of standard Perl 5 dist.

A setuid mechanism (See setuid.txt). ./configure will also ask about this.

To configure and install, run:
./configure
This will create the define files, copy the cgi-bin directory and create an admin user.

This starting point will be something like: httpd://localhost/cgi-bin/wkn/browse.cgi, depending on the location of your cgi-bin.

Also, in the util directory is a script called 'cgitohtml', which will
create a static file from a cgi script, given the cgi base.


Examples:

simple case:

util/cgitohtml /~awebuser/cgi-bin
~awebuser/public_html/cgi-bin/browse.cgi ""

Or, really specifically, on my web page (they use cgi-wrap for cgi scripts),
I do:

util/cgitohtml /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/dmahurin/wkn
~dmahurin/public_html/cgi-bin/wkn/browse.cgi "layout=page" \
"" "wknbook" "Computer/Linux" "" \
"People/Don Mahurin" "colspan=2" "People/Don Mahurin/Projects/wkn" \
> ~/public_html/index.html
