The installation creates an installation tree as follows:

What you need to get started:

Perl5 - installed as /usr/bin/perl
(if somewhere else, you need to modify all .cgi scripts using (util/perlpath) )

CGI.pm - part of standard Perl 5 dist.

To allow one user to own and modify all the notes(via the cgi scripts),
you need one of these on your web server:
    -setuid perl enabled(suidperl)
       chmod u+s *.cgi
    -cgi-wrap - http://www.unixtools.org/cgiwrap/
    -setuid apache module(suEXEC) enabled.
       http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html
     -use setuid_wrapper that was available with perl4
     -compile and use util/sperl_user.c
       cd util
       cc sperl_user -o sperl_`whoami`
       chmod a+x,u+s sperl_`whoami`
       using util/perlpath, change all cgi scripts to point to this exe.


webknotes/
	example/		- sample directory structure for WebKNotes
	cgi-bin/wkn	- wkn cgi scripts
        cgi-bin/auth    - auth cgi scripts

For the simple AUTOMATIC setup, all you have to do to get it running is:
./configure
This will create auth_define.pl and wkn_define.pl, and install example
notes and icons.

Even if you set it up manually, I suggest that you run ./configure to
get the define files basically set up.

Below is how I set up webknotes, starting with an empty public_html dir.
(I used all defaults)
----

These first few question are general questions about your web server setup

Public html directory  [/home/dmahurin/public_html]:
Public html url path  [/~dmahurin]:
cgi-bin directory  [/home/dmahurin/public_html/cgi-bin]:
cgi-bin url path  [/~dmahurin/cgi-bin]:
Private web data directory  [/home/dmahurin/web/private]:

The questions that follow allow changing the default webknotes sub paths

Document sub path  [notes]:
Create directory (y|n) [y]:
Copy sample notes (y|n) [y]:
Icons sub path  [icons]:
Create icons directory (y|n) [y]:
Copy sample icons (y|n) [y]:
cgi-bin webknotes subpath  [wkn]:
Copy webknotes cgi-bin (y|n) [y]:
Set Setuid on scripts (y|n) [y]:
Create configuration files (y|n) [y]:

----

Some have told me that I neglected to document the final step.
"How to run the damn thing?"

I put a new configure script out in CVS that creates a default index, and
 prints out the URL address of the default index and browse_help.cgi as a 
 last step.

Starting points would be:
cgi-bin/wkn/browse_notes.cgi
cgi-bin/wkn/browse_help.cgi


A main index.html file can be generated with 'cgitohtml' util.

A simple case would be:

webknotes/util/cgitohtml /~awebuser/cgi-bin
~awebuser/public_html/cgi-bin/browse_table.cgi ""

Or, really specifically, on my web page(they use cgi-wrap for cgi scripts),
I do:

webknotes/util/cgitohtml /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/dmahurin/wkn
~dmahurin/public_html/cgi-bin/wkn/browse_page.cgi \
"" "wknbook" "Computer/Linux" "" \
"People/Don Mahurin" "colspan=2" "People/Don Mahurin/Projects/wkn" \
> ~/public_html/index.html
