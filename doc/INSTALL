The installation creates an installation tree as follows:

What you need to get started:

Perl5 - installed as /usr/bin/perl
(if somewhere else, you need to modify all .cgi scripts using (util/perlpath) )

CGI.pm - part of standard Perl 5 dist.

To allow one user to own and modify all the notes(via the cgi scripts),
you need one of these on your web server:
    -setuid perl enabled(suidperl)
       chmod u+s *.cgi
    -cgi-wrap - http://www.unixtools.org/cgiwrap/
    -setuid apache module(suEXEC) enabled.
       http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html
     -use setuid_wrapper that was available with perl4
     -compile and use util/sperl_user.c
       cd util
       cc sperl_user -o sperl_`whoami`
       chmod a+x,u+s sperl_`whoami`
       using util/perlpath, change all cgi scripts to point to this exe.


webknotes/
	example/		- sample directory structure for WebKNotes
	cgi-bin/wkn	- wkn cgi scripts
        cgi-bin/auth    - auth cgi scripts

For the simple AUTOMATIC setup, all you have to do to get it running is:
./configure
This will create auth_define.pl and wkn_define.pl, and install example
notes and icons.

Even if you set it up manually, I suggest that you run ./configure to
get the define files basically set up.

The complicated MANUAL instructions were removed because they were out of
date, and ... complicated.
