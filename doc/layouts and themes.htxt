Layouts and themes are saved with a user settings. For anonymous users,
the settings are passed along with each request.
You can change the layout and theme, by choosing "Layout/theme" at the
bottom of the page.  If you wish to create your own theme, see [[css]].

The layout of the file and directory listing can also be changed.
Also there can be a "super layout" specified. This is actually a layout that
contains another layout. Typically this is a framed layout or nothing.
