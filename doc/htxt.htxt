HTXT files are txt files with simple Hyper links and some implied
text formatting.

Links are specified with [ [ LINK ] ] ( brackets are not space separated in a actual link. )

LINK has the form RELLINK or URLLINK or URLLINK|LINKTEXT or RELLINK|LINKTEXT.

Where rellink is a relative link to a directory or file or to another htxt file (specifying the extention is optional).
