The permission flags are as follows:
r - read
n - add note
o - owner permissions
c - create
m - modify
d - delete
s - system privalege

When checking for permission, the following happens:
if user is logged in: 
   they get the permissions in the user file.
   if .permissions file exists permissions are modified accordingly.
      "-" takes away permissions. ex: -cmd
      "+" adds permission. ex: +m
      "=" sets permission. ex: =rno
   if .owner exists and matches user,
      user gets additional permissions in $wkn_owner_permissions
   if .group exists and user is in that group, user get additional
      group permissions.

if user is not logged in:
   default permissions apply.
   if .permissions exists, permissions are modified accordingly.

.permissions examples:

No permissions(Only useful if .group permissions exist):
=

No note permission(but if o is default for a user, only a logged in
user could add a note):
-n
