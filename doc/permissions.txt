Permissions are obtained in the following order:

If current path is in users AuthRoot, The permissions are set to flags
in Users Permissions.

If current path is in a defined 'path_permission' path, the corresponding
permission modifiers are applied.
  ex: $path_permissions = (""=> "+rn");#gives everyone read and note permission

If .permissions file exists, the permission modifiers contained are applied.

For path permissions and .permissions, the string is a permissions modifier.
The format is:
((o|g|a)?(+|-|=))?(.*)
