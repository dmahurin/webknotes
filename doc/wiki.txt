Ok,

If you can't beat'em, assimilate ...

I don't really understand why the wikis are so popular.
So I gave up, and attempted to support .wiki as if it was a markup language.

There's a importwiki tool included to mine some wikis.

It remains unclear what mixing .wiki's and .wiki catagories and text and
html really will look like.

hopefully, people can use this in whatever way works.

There are still some issues to work our as to how to properly wiki in
a hierarchy.

But some hierarchy has to help a little more than a flat directory for
some casual browsing. Maybe I'll write an "auto hierarchy/auto link" program
to generate a basic hierarchy.  Or maybe you will ...
